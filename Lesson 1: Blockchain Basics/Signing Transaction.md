# Signing Transaction :bank:

### Private Key:

Only known to the key holder, it's used to "sign" transactions.

### Public Key:

Is derived from the private key. Anyone can "see" it, and use it to verify that a transaction came from you.

### Signing a transaction:

A "one way" process. Someone with a private key signs a transaction by their private key being hashed with their transaction data.

Anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key.
